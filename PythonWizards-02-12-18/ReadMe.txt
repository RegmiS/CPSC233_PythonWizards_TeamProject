Thus far we have:
- a menu class which sets up the menu with a few simple buttons
- start button that takes you to the game screen
- a basic temporary path
- an enemy class with working features and some methods to be used later
- a enemy spawns and paths to the base
- a temporary "base"

what we are currently working on:

- a better path
- a simple tower to start with
- spawning multiple enemies
- getting the enemies to appear ontop of the path
- assigning the base health
- a point system for placing towers
- a new background (using squares like a grid for placing towers)

TEST EDIT
